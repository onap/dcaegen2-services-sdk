      "message": "Two main issues:\n- this class does not have unit tests\n- this implementation is very specific to one type of endpoint. SDK is meant to be a general purpose shared library. Having endpoints hardcoded on this level means each client will have this very specific part of functionality as a dependency. I\u0027d strongly suggest moving this class to PRH. \nOf course I do realize that this problem has already existed, i.e. use case specific interfaces (with correlation itd etc), but this will be refactored so let\u0027s keep the future changes to a minimum:)",

This should not be the case - unit tests that check all possible outcomes should suffice for and would implicitly detect any change in references :)",
