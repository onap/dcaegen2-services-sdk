      "message": "Ok, but if this is only for inserting some bad data and we are expecting to use it ONLY in tests conditions we should mark this fact in this description. e.g. Something like \"Method for test purposes. Do not use it on production\"\nBut even though term \"message\" is too enigmatic.\nWhat messages? VesEvents as a raw?\nWTP message as a raw? ...\nOrdinary developer-\"user\" of our lib could feel lost.\nMaybe instead of \"ves event as a raw\", mark it with \"payload of WTP as a raw\"",

      "message": "Actually it\u0027s not for test purposes. It\u0027s more generic version of the other send method. Right now we\u0027re sending only ves events, but in the future someone could want to send some other message types. That\u0027s why we have payloadId field in wire frame. I think, that target user should not know about such thing like wire frame, only about the payload they want to send (VesEvent or some other message type), then the \"message\" term isn\u0027t ambiguous. Someone other should make they statement about this though.",
